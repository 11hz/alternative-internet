## How to add your project

1. Fork/Clone this repository
2. Add a new JSON file in the projects/ folder
3. Make the JSON look like the example below.
4. Check your JSON is valid
5. Send a PR

### Example Project JSON file

```json
{
    "name": "My project",
    "description": "My project aims to fix problems with centralisation by....",
    "languages" : ["C++", "Python"],
    "homepage": "https://myprojecthomepage",
    "sourcecode": "https://github.com/..."
}
```

If the languages part isn't relevant, just use []. If it's not open (why not?) use "".  All other fields are required.

Not yet, working on it.
