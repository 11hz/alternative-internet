  This small site contains all of the projects listed at the <a href="https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet">Alternative Internet Github repo</a> in a moderately prettier format. It still contains "a collection of interesting new networks and tech aiming at decentralisation (in some form)" but without the giant table.
