description: "Dyne's [Tomb](https://tomb.dyne.org/) the crypto-undertaker is free software for easy encryption and backup of personal files, written in a single ZShell script that is easy to review and links commonly shared components (such as cryptsetup), unlike TrueCrypt.  Tomb implements and encourages OPSEC best-practice, and comes with bind and execution hooks, steganography of keys and fast search over filenames and contents, and a graphical user interface."
