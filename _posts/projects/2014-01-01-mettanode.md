name: MettaNode
description: "MettaNode is a tool for fully decentralized communications - grab data you like and store it forever, share data with your friends, start chats, voice or video calls, form groups by interest, transparently keep all your notes between all of your devices; all based on a simple ideas of [UIA](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/uia/). It is still in its infancy and only base transport protocol is done, work is now going on on overlay routing network. Final target is to have a bunch of clients for desktop and mobile platforms (Win, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS) as well as own operating system implementation (Metta) running together."
