description: "Known is a simple way to share your story with a variety of media, from any device. Aligned with the indie web movement, Known sites can be installed on your own server, and each one will operate as a node in a global social network, together with other indie web platforms. Known is fully extensible and supports microblogging, photos, articles, events, location check-ins and bookmarks out of the box. It is a responsive web platform that works on anything with a web browser."
