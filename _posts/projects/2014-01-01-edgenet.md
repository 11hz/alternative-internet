name: edgenet
description: "edgenet is a peer-to-peer opportunistic network built over mobile devices (and potentially home routers). It is a concept, with many layers already build (ZeroMQ, Zyre). It uses temporary 'cells' to connect devices and exchange information opportunistically. It's suited to decentralized chat and proximity networking."
