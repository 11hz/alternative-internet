description: "Tent is a protocol that puts users back in control. Users should control the data they create, choose who can access it, and change service providers without losing their social graph.Tent is a protocol, not a platform. Like email, anyone can build Tent apps or host Tent servers, all Tent servers can talk to each other, and there is no central authority to restrict users or developers."
